# üèì raquest (raq)

Raquest is a minimalist command-line HTTP client on top of `libcurl`. It's a foss `curl++`-like response to closed-source bloatware like Insomnia and Postman being absolute shite. No monthly subscriptions or two minute ads to access your requests, just save them in `.raq` files, run `raq -f <query_name>.raq`, and move on with your life.
