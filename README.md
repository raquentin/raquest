# üèì raquest (raq)

Raquest is a batteries-excluded command-line HTTP client built Insomnia and Postman are trash. No monthly subscriptions or two minute ads to send raquests, just run `raq -f <query_name>.raq` and move on with your life.

## Features

### `.raq` files

Requests with 'raquest' are written in `'.raq'` files. They are similar to writing `curl` commands in bash scripts.

```
[request]
POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

[headers]
Authorization: Bearer exampletoken12345
Content-Type: application/json
Custom-Header: custom_value

[body type="json"]
{
  "title": "foo",
  "body": "bar",
  "userId": 1
}

[assertion on="status"]
201

[assertion on="response"]
{
  "message": "foo"
}
```
